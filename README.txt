This UUI4Linux variant allows you to create a Multiboot Bootable USB drive from Linux. 
It works by installing Universal USB Installer theme and configuration files with a Ventoy bootloader. 

To run the UUI.sh script from a terminal:

chmod +x ./UUI.sh && ./UUI.sh

Once finished, the included Universal-USB-Installer-#.exe can be run from WINE to download and install distributions and persistence files onto any drive that has already been prepared.

wine Universal-USB*
